- [ ] What happened to the battery and/or the controller?
  - When I plugged in the battery backwards, smoke came out
    - But both the battery and the controller _seemed_ to work
    - I was able to reset the controller and see the dials move after removing the plug
  - The battery now appears to have no charge at all
  - I'm not sure if the microcontroller is cursed too
- [ ] How much charge can I really get from the battery?
  - wakeCurrentDraw = 150mA expected, 250mA max
  - wakeTime = expected 20s, but need to measure with serial and telemetry
  - servoCurrentDraw = 540mA min, 1650mA max (but probably on the lowest end? Should measure)
  - servoTime = assume 2s, but will need to enforce this with gpio and the transistor
  - sleepingCurrent draw = 2uA (will need to remove the LED, otherwise 2mA)
  - sleepTime = 3600s
  - Formula: `(wakeCurrentDraw * wakeTime) + (servoCurrentDraw * servoTime) + (sleepingCurrentDraw * sleepTime)`
  - Current case (no servos, including power LED): `(250mA * 40s) (2.4mA * 3600s) = 18,640mAs = 5.2 mAh -> 192 h runtime for 1k mAh battery -> 8 days (why isn't battery dead yet?)`
  - Worst case: `(250mA * 40s) + (1650mA * 40s) + (2mA * 3600s) = 83,200mAs = 23.1 mAh -> 43.3 h runtime for 1k mAh battery -> 1.8 days :(`
  - Best case: `(150mA * 10s) + (540mA * 2s) + (0.002mA * 3600s) = 2,587mAs = 0.71 mAh -> 1,408 h runtime for 1k mAh battery -> 59 days :(`
  - Even better case: `(90mA * 5s) + (540mA * 2s) + (0.002mA * 3600s) = 1,537mAs = 0.43 mAh -> 2,326 h runtime for 1k mAh battery -> 194 days (if you don't run at night) :|`
    - `(450mAs) + (1080mAs) + (7.2mAs)
  - Dreamy case: `(90mA * 5s) + (540mA * 0.5s) + (0.002mA * 3600s) = 792mAs = 0.22 mAh -> 4,545 h runtime for 1k mAh battery -> 379 days (if you don't run at night) :)`
  - Memory case (if conditions don't change frequently): `(90mA * 5s) + (540mA * 0.5s)/2 + (0.010ma * 3600s) = 621mAs = 0.17 mAh -> 5,882 h runtime for 1k mAh battery -> 490 days (if you don't run at night and conditions are the same 50% of the time) :)`
  - Need to confirm:
    - How long does the whole process _really_ take?
      - Can we get it down to 5s??
    - How much current does the esp draw during runtime?
      - Is it near 150mA? 90mA?
    - How much current do the motors really draw when moving?
      - Is it close to 540mA? Maybe less because of the lower voltage?
    - How much current does hibernation really draw?
      - We expect 2uA, but we'll need to remove the power LED to know for sure
- [ ] Why isn't the cycle running on the hour?
  - It seems that the cycle timer isn't very accurate
    - Sometimes we undershoot and run at X:59, and sometimes we overshoot and somehow skip an hour
  - What we should do is clamp the cycle time at 1hr +/- 10 minutes
  - OR, calculate three possible hour times, and pick the one closest to 60 minutes
  - OR, if the cycle time is < 20% of a cycle, add another full cycle
- [ ] How can we really test the battery life with/without servos?
  - [ ] Get a site where we can see the telemetry
    - Make a chart to see the number of pings/hour
  - [ ] Reliably query results every 10 mins
  - [ ] Add a pin that measures voltage between two large, equal resistors
    - Also chart that value over time
  - [ ] The current output for JUST the esp should be this:
    - (no servos, including power LED): 
      - With 10 min cycles:
        - batteryContents = 1000 mAh = (espRunningConsumptionPerCycle + espRestingConsumptionPerCycleWithLED) * totalNumCycles
        - batteryContents = 1000 mAh = (100mA * 30s + 2mA * 600s) * totalNumCycles
        - 1000 mAh = (3000 mAs + 1200 mAs) * totalNumCycles

      - With 5 min cycles:
        - batteryContents = 1000 mAh = (100mA * 30s + 2mA * 300s) * totalNumCycles
        - 1000 mAh = (3000 mAs + 600 mAs) * totalNumCycles

      - With 2 min cycles:
        - batteryContents = 1000 mAh = (100mA * 30s + 2mA * 120s) * totalNumCycles
        - 1000 mAh = (3000 mAs + 240 mAs) * totalNumCycles
        - 1111 = totalNumberCycles = 2222 minutes = 37 hours ~= 1.5 days 
    - (no servos, remove power LED): 
      - batteryContents = 1000 mAh = (espRunningConsumptionPerCycle + espRestingConsumptionPerCycleNoLED) * totalNumCycles
